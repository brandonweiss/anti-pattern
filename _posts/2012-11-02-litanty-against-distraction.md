_I must not get distracted._
Distraction is the mind-killer.
Distraction is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
I will face my distraction.
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
Where the distraction has gone there will be nothing.
Only I will remain.
