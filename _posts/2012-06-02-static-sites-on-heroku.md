I've been using [Heroku](http://heroku.com) to host my Ruby applications pretty much since day one. Not having to waste countless hours managing servers or dealing with crappy shared hosting control panels is fantastic and I can't recommend it highly enough. But I've always had a number of static HTML sites, and I didn't really know what to do with those, so I just kept them on old-school shared hosting. Then about a year ago I finally got fed up with having to FTP into my shared server to make changesâ€”managing my static sites should be as easy as managing my web apps.

My first thought was to use [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com), an awesome, lightweight Ruby application framework. But that's way overkill to just serve some static HTML files. However, Sinatra is built on top of [Rack](https://github.com/rack/rack), a common interface for building Ruby applications. Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, and all other Ruby web frameworks use it. I realized I could just write a really simple Rack app to serve my various static sites.

At its simplest, a Rack app is just an object that responds to a `call` method, and returns an Array of three things. A status code, a Hash of HTTP headers, and an Array of Strings that make up the body. The Rack app that runs my [personal site](http://brandonweiss.me) looks like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
# Gemfile
source "http://rubygems.org"

gem "rack"

# config.ru
require "rubygems"
require "bundler"
Bundler.require(:default)

map "/" do
  use Rack::Static, urls: ["/assets"], root: Dir.pwd

  run lambda { |env|
    headers = {
      "Content-Type"  => "text/html",
      "Cache-Control" => "public, max-age=86400"
    }
    body = File.open("#{Dir.pwd}/index.html", File::RDONLY).read

    [200, headers, [body]]
  }
end
{% endhighlight %}

I put my images, stylesheets, and javascripts in the assets folder, toss an `index.html` file in the root and that's it.
