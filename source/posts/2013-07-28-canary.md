For the last few months I've been working on something new. I live and work on the Internet, so it's very important that my various websites, web apps, and whatnots are all up and working properly. That moment when you realize that something is broken, that it's been that way for hours—or even longer—and you had no idea, sucks.

There are a few different products and services that attempt to solve this problem, but they're either really difficult to use, ridiculously expensive, or in most cases, both. These products are all targeted at large businesses, and although I might not be large, I _am_ a business. I want to know when things go wrong, but I don't want to have to pay $50+ a month to know it. I don't want to be up-sold for every basic feature. I don't want to wait days for help and talk to an unhelpful robot when I finally get it. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect to pay a fair amount every month for a great product made by great people. So I'm building the product I want.

It's called [Canary][canary]. Right now it will ping URLs and let you know when they go down and when they go back up. I've teamed up with my friend and co-founder, [Avand][avand]. We're starting small and plan to work our way up; we've got some really awesome features planned.

If you're ready to know when things go wrong before anyone else does, [sign up for Canary][canary].
